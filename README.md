# MHR-Mesh-Panel
Adds a Blender Panel to rename Vertex Groups to their MHR counterpart. And to rotate+scale meshes to help porting of MHW meshes

It also has buttons in the panel to convert any physics bones from MHW to MHR, with choices of Breastbones or generic physics bones.
Breasts assumes the breastbones uses the first two available physics bones in MHW which is 150 for the Left Breast and 152 for the Right Breast
The generic Physics bone renaming will simply name them Physics_xx
